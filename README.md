## Project Objective: A Brief Overview
This project has been developed as an incentive program aimed at increasing the usage of TK Wallet, a new product by Turkish Airlines. 
Our goal is to guarantee that the customer will receive the cheapest ticket price from the date of purchase of a ticket purchased with TK Wallet until the flight time.
After the flight takes place, the difference between the price paid for the ticket and the cheapest price between the date of purchase of the ticket and the flight date is refunded to the customer.

## Prototype
> In this figma prototype, I tried to simulate a customer purchasing a ticket via the Turkish Airlines application with TK Wallet.

## Flight Completion and Refund Processing Flow
> In this diagram, I tried to explain how the system works and what the process is from the moment a flight takes place to the refund process.
